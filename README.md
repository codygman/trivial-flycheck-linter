# trivial-flycheck-linter

My attempt at making the most trivial [flycheck]() linter I could think of using the [flycheck docks on defining syntax checkers](http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/_downloads/flycheck.html#Defining-syntax-checkers) and the [flycheck gitter](https://gitter.im/flycheck/flycheck).
